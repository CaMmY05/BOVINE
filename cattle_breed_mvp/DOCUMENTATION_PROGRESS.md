## 🎯 How to Continue

### Option 1: Add Parts One by One
I'll add each part (C, D, E, etc.) to the HTML file sequentially, keeping each addition under the token limit.

### Option 2: Create Separate HTML Files
Create separate files for each major section and link them together:
- `documentation_overview.html` (Parts A & B) ✅
- `documentation_setup.html` (Part C)
- `documentation_data.html` (Part D)
- `documentation_architecture.html` (Part E)
- etc.

### Option 3: Create Multi-Page Website
Build a complete multi-page documentation website with navigation.

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Ready to add Part C (Setup Guide)?**

Just say:
- "Add Part C" - I'll add the complete setup guide
- "Add Part D" - I'll add data collection details
- "Continue with all parts" - I'll add all remaining parts one by one
- "Create separate files" - I'll create individual HTML files for each section
